### Design tools and applications to download
You are more than welcome to use your favorite text editor. In addition to any project specific tools that you may have to download, it is important to have tools **figma**(https://www.figma.com/downloads/) and **zeplin**(https://support.zeplin.io/en/articles/244698-downloading-mac-and-windows-apps). These tools are used by our graphic designers to help us visualize our applications before actual implementation commences.
